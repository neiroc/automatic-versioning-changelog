## Features

- **Automated Versioning:** Uses [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) to manage versioning and changelog generation.
- **Consistent Commit Style:** Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to maintain a clean and understandable commit history.
- **Automated Changelogs:** Generates changelogs based on commit messages.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project and use Semantic Release with Conventional Commits.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Git

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neiroc/repo-name.git
   ```
   cd repo-name

## Versioning

This project uses Semantic Versioning:

- `MAJOR`: Breaking changes
- `MINOR`: New features (backward-compatible)
- `PATCH`: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

Semantic Release and Conventional Commits automate this process to ensure consistent versioning.
